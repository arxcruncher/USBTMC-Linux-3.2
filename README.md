USBTMC-Linux-3.2
================

A patched USBTMC driver for Linux 3.2. This is the only driver code to get my Rigol DM3068 working under Linux 3.2, and compiling without errors or warnings.


DISCLAIMER:

Their is still a bug somewhere, I believe in the ioctl functionalities. When the module is removed from the kernel, your system will crash! So you better leave it in there...
